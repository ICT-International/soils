The soils repository contains the R code to support the use of the ICT International and third party sensors for the measurement of key soil parameters, such as soil moisture content (VWC%), soil water potential (kPa or MPa) and temperature (degrees celsius).

This code can be used with the measurements direct from the sensor when connected to a suitable data logger, or with an ICT International IoT node and the subsequent data transmitted via IoT.
